# Developing for DeltaProxy

You can enhance experience of DeltaProxy users by developing new useful modules. A module is a DLL that is loaded by DeltaProxy at runtime. A module acts as a separate program that can access and edit any data of any other module, as well as base DeltaProxy code, module manager, built-in ConnectionInfoHolder module and different type extensions.
